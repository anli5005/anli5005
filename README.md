Hi! I'm [Anthony Li](https://anli.dev), a developer and student at the University of Pennsylvania ([M&T](https://fisher.wharton.upenn.edu).)

A few fun facts about me, because what else is a GitHub README good for:
* :wave: I go by Anthony, but also **anli** sometimes
* :bubble_tea: I drink a copious amount of bubble tea
* :sushi: Oh, and also sushi
* :speech_balloon: I speak English (natively), French (not very well), and Mandarin (also not very well)
    * N'hésitez pas à me contacter en français si vous voudriez voir comment mon français est terrible
* :mobile_phone: I teach an [iOS course](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1951/25sp/) and make cool stuff for the university at [Penn Labs](https://pennlabs.org)!
